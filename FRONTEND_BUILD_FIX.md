# 🚀 Frontend Build Fix - Vite Not Found Issue

## 🔍 **Problem Identified**
The frontend and admin builds were failing with:
```
sh: 1: vite: not found
==> Build failed 😞
```

## 🎯 **Root Cause**
- `vite` is listed as a **devDependency** in both `frontend/package.json` and `admin/package.json`
- Render's build process runs with `NODE_ENV=production`
- By default, `npm install` in production mode **skips devDependencies**
- But `vite` is needed for the build process (`npm run build`)

## ✅ **Fix Applied**

### **Updated render.yaml build commands:**

#### Before:
```yaml
buildCommand: |
  cd frontend
  npm install        # ❌ Skips devDependencies in production
  npm run build      # ❌ vite not available
```

#### After:
```yaml
buildCommand: |
  cd frontend
  npm install --include=dev    # ✅ Installs devDependencies too
  npm run build                # ✅ vite now available
```

### **Applied to both services:**
- ✅ **Frontend**: `rentiva-frontend` build command updated
- ✅ **Admin**: `rentiva-admin` build command updated

## 🔧 **Technical Details**
- `--include=dev` flag forces npm to install devDependencies even in production mode
- This ensures build tools like `vite`, `eslint`, etc. are available during build
- Production runtime still only uses regular dependencies

## 📋 **Files Modified**
- `render.yaml` - Updated build commands for both frontend services

## 🚀 **Expected Result**
After the next deploy:
```
==> Running build command 'npm install --include=dev && npm run build'...
