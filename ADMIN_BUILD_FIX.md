# Admin Build Fix Summary

## Issue
The admin panel build was failing on Render with the error:
```
Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find package 'vite' imported from /opt/render/project/src/admin/node_modules/.vite-temp/vite.config.js.timestamp-1750157909436-a0d3c854373c1.mjs
```

## Root Cause
The `vite` package was located in `devDependencies` in the admin `package.json` file, but the build process on Render was running `npm ci --only=production` which excludes development dependencies.

## Solution
1. **Moved Vite to Production Dependencies**: Moved `vite` and `@vitejs/plugin-react` from `devDependencies` to `dependencies` in `/admin/package.json`

2. **Fixed render.yaml**: Cleaned up duplicate environment variables and formatting issues in the render.yaml configuration

3. **Enhanced vite.config.js**: Added proper environment variable definition for production builds

## Changes Made

### 1. admin/package.json
- Moved `vite: "^6.3.5"` from devDependencies to dependencies
- Moved `@vitejs/plugin-react: "^4.4.1"` from devDependencies to dependencies

### 2. render.yaml  
- Fixed formatting issues and duplicate environment variable definitions
- Ensured proper YAML structure for admin panel deployment

### 3. admin/vite.config.js
- Added `define` section to properly handle NODE_ENV in production builds

## Test Results
✅ Local admin build: **SUCCESSFUL**
✅ Local frontend build: **SUCCESSFUL**  
✅ Dist folders created with proper assets
✅ No build errors or warnings (except chunk size notification)

## Deployment Ready
The project is now ready for deployment on Render. The build process should work correctly with the fixed dependencies and configuration.

## Key Files Modified
- `admin/package.json` - Dependency reorganization
- `render.yaml` - Configuration cleanup  
- `admin/vite.config.js` - Production environment setup

## Next Steps
1. Commit and push changes to GitHub
2. Trigger new deployment on Render
3. Monitor deployment logs to confirm successful build
